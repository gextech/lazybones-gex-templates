# Simple Spring Boot Rest Template

This is a simple project using Spring Boot REST API
it is highly opinionated, we chose to use:

* Spring Boot
* Jersey
* OAuth 2
* Postgresql
* GORM
* RAML contracts with code generation

It should be pretty easy to change the database, or OAuth security.
We would recommend against it.
